<p> Prince Rogers Nelson (June 7, 1958 - April, 2016)was a music all-rounder  from singer to songwriting playing multi instruments and producing. He was born and bread in Minneapolis and stayed there until the day he died. He was signed to Warner Brother at the age of 18, but at a later stage in his career he took them to court so we could gain back his rights to his music. Prince gave us over 39 albums and it said that he had a vault of music with 1000â€™s more music he did not release. </p>
